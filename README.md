ApiProbe
=======
ApiProbe is an EVE Online Api key analyzer that analyzes relationships between players by looking at Wallet Transactions, Contracts, Mails and other data.

Warning
-------
None of the above is working yet, I just started to develop the app.
As I do this mainly as a way to learn more about C# and WPF don't
expect development to be particularly fast.
